- when new area is add into yaml, check if thats areas not already exists in ftl before its added there
- to current command 'addComp link' add option to do 'addComp customCompoennts/link' same as 'addComp anotherModule:components/link' (if module name or path is not there then one from current module will be used)
- improve yaml > json > yaml not to throw away comments (# ...) or includes
