- since you reading this, you should see also 'package.json' file, '_prototypes' and 'bin' in same directory as is this readme file

- copy 'apache-tomcat-7.0.64' in same location (apache-tomcat for example from magnolia 5.4.4 CE)

- now is time to do configuration changes in package.json (resource folder structure, copy resources, edit magnolia properties....), just have a look whats there, for demo you don't have to change anything

- in same location (where is 'package.json') open terminal and run 'npm install && sudo npm link' (you will need node.js installed to be to do npm commands, recommend to use latest version). because of 'sudo npm link' you will need to type superuser password (without that you will be not able to use 'addPage','addComp', etc. commands later...)

- then run 'npm start' (when done you should see new 'resources' folder when done. then you may also 'ctrl+c' this command if stacks)

- start Magnolia from 'apache-tomcat-7.0.64/bin' (better in new terminal window), follow up and finish installation

- create new page using 'addPage myHome' (in terminal where package.json is, same for all other steps)

- go to Magnolia > pages app, add new page with 'myHome' template

- create new component using 'addComp myText available@awesome:pages/myHome@main'

- on 'myHome' page you may now add 'myText' component into main area

- you may also create new component without availability just using 'createComponent myLink'

- and add availability later using 'addAvailability awesome:components/myLink available@awesome:pages/myHome@main' (this same as 'addComp' you may also use to create completely new area, which will also add area freemarker scrit into ftl file. Or instead of 'available@...' you may do 'autogenerate@...' which will configure autoGenerated component in area)

- this way you may add availability also for components across others light module

- BTW less files are watched for changes, so go to 'resources/awesome/css/bootstrap-less' open for instance 'variables.less' and change something, e.g. #29 '@body-bg: #ddd;' and reload frame in Magnolia page editor, you should see changed automaticaly

- another examples of available commands:
$: addComp footer available@awesome:pages/myHome@footer
$: addComp footerLink available@awesome:components/footer@col1
$: addAvailability awesome:components/footerLink available@awesome:components/footer@col2
$: addAvailability awesome:components/footerLink available@awesome:components/footer@col3
$: addAvailability awesome:components/footerLink available@awesome:components/footer@col4
$: addComp intro autogenerate@awesome:pages/myHome@intro
