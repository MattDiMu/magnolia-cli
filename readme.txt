- nodejs has to be installed (tested with 5.4.1, one of dependent tools had issue to work with 5.6 so 5.4.1 is really recomend)

- best practice to have this 'Magnolia_light_dev_cli' tool in 'cli' folder in your working directory, side by side with apache-tomcat (copy one manually for example from magnolia 5.4.4 CE bundle) and 'light-modules' folder (which will be created automatically by script, if doesn't exist)

- folder structure may looks like:
    <yourWorkingDirectory>
    - apache-tomcat-7.0.64
    - cli
    - light-modules

- open <yourWorkingDirectory>/cli in terminal and run 'npm install && sudo npm link' (you will need node.js installed to be to do npm commands, recommend to use latest version). because of 'sudo npm link' you will need to type superuser password (without that you will be not able to use 'addPage','addComp', etc. commands later...)

- now is time to do configuration changes in cli/package.json (resource folder structure, copy resources, edit magnolia properties....), just have a look whats there (for demo you don't have to change anything, just be sure that path in editMagnoliaProperties is correct)

- then in cli folder run 'npm start' ('light-modules' has to be created and/or filled with other folders folder when done. then you may also 'ctrl+c' this command if stacks (because of watch command))

- start Magnolia from 'apache-tomcat-7.0.64/bin' (better in new terminal window), follow up and finish installation

- create new page using command 'addPage myHome' (in 'cli' folder, same for all other steps)

- go to Magnolia > pages app, add new page with 'myHome' template

- create new component using 'addComp textImage available@sampleModule:pages/myHome@main'

- on 'myHome' page you may now add 'textImage' component into main area

- you may also create new component without availability just using 'addComp image' and add availability later

- or you may create component and make him autogenerated on page 'addComp footer autogenerate@sampleModule:pages/myHome@footer'

- to add availability to anything use command like 'addAvailability mtk:components/html available@sampleModule:pages/myHome@main' 

- BTW less files are watched for changes, so go to '/light-modules/sampleModule/webresources/css/bootstrap-less' open for instance 'scaffolding.less' and add there this code "footer { background-color: @gray-dark; color: #fff;}" (you should also have footer area rendered in <footer></footer> in main.ftl)
