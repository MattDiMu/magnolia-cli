# Magnolia Light Development CLI tool #

An npm package providing a CLI tool to setup and facilitate light development with Magnolia


## Installation ##
Before installation make sure you have  Node.js installed
```
node -v
```

Then navigate to your <yourWorkingDirectory> and run (`magnolia-cli` is not on npm repository yet, so pls use second way)
```
npm install magnolia-cli
```
or install it from locale source e.g.
```
npm install magnolia-cli-1.0.0.tgz
```
After this first step installation (which is like reconfiguration for CLI tool) navigate into `/cli` folder
```
cd cli
```
and run second step installation plus link script to be executable (have to do it with sudo permissions)

```
npm install && sudo npm link
```

## Configuration ##
Found `package.json` file in `cli` folder and open it to edit.

As you can see there is a lot of stuff already preconfigured to happens during build (npm start). But lets describe some of them:


## Build ##
From now all command for CLI tool _has to be executed from `cli` folder_.

Once you checked or edited `package.json` file you can build/start project using command:

```
npm start
```

After this you should have folder structure like this (may be different if you edit `package.json`)
```
<yourWorkingDirectory>
    - apache-tomcat
    - cli
    - light-modules
```

If you change some configuration in `package.json` file later you can repeat 'npm start' command. Or execute just specific command like:

```
npm run mgnlbuild
npm run donwloadMagnolia
npm run unzipMagnolia
npm run editMagnoliaProperties
npm run downloadJars
npm run createFolders
npm run copyResources
```
**Don't forget they will always do stuff based on current configuration in `package.json` file, so it may override some of your manual changes in project.** 


## Commands ##
Add/create page template (will create page yaml file, main.ftl and page dialog)
```
add-page myHome
```

Add/create component template (will create component yaml file, component  ftl and component dialog)
```
add-component image
```

Same as above plus will set this component available on 'myHome' page in 'main' area (if area or availability configuration doesn't exist's in 'myHome' page, will create it as well)
```
add-component textImage available@sampleModule:pages/myHome@main
```

Same as above, just will do 'autogeneration' instead of availability
```
add-component footer autogenerate@sampleModule:pages/myHome@footer
```

Make component 'html' available at 'myHome' in 'main' area
```
add-availability mtk:components/html available@sampleModule:pages/myHome@main
```



## Example ##
* start Magnolia from `apache-tomcat/bin` (better in new terminal window), follow up and finish installation
* create new page using command `add-page myHome` (in the `cli` folder, same for all other steps)
* go to Magnolia > pages app, add new page with 'myHome` template
* create new component using `add-component textImage available@sampleModule:pages/myHome@main`
* on 'myHome' page you may now add 'textImage' component into main area
* you may also create new component without availability just using `add-component image` and add availability later
* or you may create component and make him autogenerated on page `add-component footer autogenerate@sampleModule:pages/myHome@footer`
* to add availability to anything use command like `add-availability mtk:components/html available@sampleModule:pages/myHome@main` 
* if 'start' script includes './bin/watchBootstrap.js' then `less` files are watched for changes, so go to `/light-modules/sampleModule/webresources/css/bootstrap-less` open for instance `scaffolding.less` and add there this code `footer { background-color: @gray-dark; color: #fff;}` (you should also have footer area rendered in `<footer></footer>` in main.ftl)
